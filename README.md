# **Introduction**
The Laundry Basket is a comprehensive project designed to streamline and enhance the
laundry service experience for both customers and laundry owners. This system
encompasses a wide range of functionalities, including customer and laundry owner
registration and login processes, enabling secure access to the platform.
Customers can effortlessly manage their profiles, edit personal information, and
conveniently place orders for laundry services. Laundry owners, on the other hand, can
also manage their profiles, add or remove services, and view feedback from customers.
The system supports a robust order management system, allowing customers to track
their orders, update their status, and even accept or reject orders as per their
preferences. Additionally, the system maintains a comprehensive order history for
reference, making it a valuable tool for the efficient and transparent management of
laundry services.
These integrated features not only enhance user experience but also contribute to
operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, making this system an invaluable asset
for the laundry service sector.
